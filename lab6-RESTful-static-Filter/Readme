We can filter out sensitive data like password or card number in the response.
Support backward compatibility, by removing newly added properties.


There are two types for flitering:
Static Filtering
Dynamic Filtering:



"User”  contains fields like: id, email, fullName, password, secretKey

When the recipient has an “admin” role, we should return the full object with the fields: id, email, fullName, password, secretKey.

When a recipient has a “user” role, we should return an object partially with the fields: email, fullName.
