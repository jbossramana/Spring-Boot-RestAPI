Step 1: Create the Category by sending a POST request to its endpoint.

URL: http://localhost:8080/category

Method: POST

Body:

{
  "name": "New Category"
}

Step 2: Create the Task and link it to the Category using the URI from the previous step.

URL: http://localhost:8080/task

Method: POST

Body:


{
  "description": "New Task Description",
  "category": "http://localhost:8080/category/1"
}



@RepositoryRestResource(path = "employees", collectionResourceRel = "employees")
public interface EmployeeRepository extends JpaRepository<Employee, Long> {

    @Procedure("get_employees_by_department")
    List<Employee> getEmployeesByDepartment(@Param("dept_name") String department);

    @Query("SELECT e FROM Employee e WHERE e.department = :deptName")
    List<Employee> findEmployeesByDepartment(@Param("deptName") String deptName);
}


Spring Data REST will expose them at URLs like:

/employees/search/findEmployeesByDepartment
/employees/search/getEmployeeById
