Internationalization (i18n) is the process of designing and preparing your app to be usable in 
different locales around the world. Localization is the process of building versions of your app 
for different locales, including extracting text for translation into different languages, and 
formatting data for particular locales.

A locale identifies a region (such as a country) in which people speak a particular language or 
language variant. The locale determines the formatting and parsing of dates, times, numbers, and 
currencies as well as measurement units and the translated names for time zones, languages, 
and countries.

The LocaleResolver interface has implementations that determine the current locale based on the session, 
cookies, the Accept-Language header, or a fixed value.

SessionLocaleResolver is used to set a default locale with value US.

CookieLocaleResolver: This locale resolver inspects a Cookie.
