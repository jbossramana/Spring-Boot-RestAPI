JUnit 5 Architecture
====================

As compared to JUnit 4, JUnit 5 is composed of several different modules from three different sub-projects:

JUnit 5 aims to adapt java 8 style of coding and several other features


JUnit 5 = JUnit Platform + JUnit Jupiter + JUnit Vintage
JUnit Platform
To be able to launch junit tests, IDEs, build tools or plugins need to include and extend platform APIs. It defines the TestEngine API for developing new testing frameworks that runs on the platform.
It also provides a Console Launcher to launch the platform from the command line and build plugins for Gradle and Maven.

JUnit Jupiter
It includes new programming and extension models for writing tests. It has all new junit annotations and TestEngine implementation to run tests written with these annotations.

JUnit Vintage
It primary purpose is to support running JUnit 3 and JUnit 4 written tests on the JUnit 5 platform. Itâ€™s there are backward compatibility.
