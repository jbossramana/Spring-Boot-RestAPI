Application Context Hierarchy
=============================

We can have multiple application contexts that share a parent-child relationship.

A context hierarchy allows multiple child contexts to share beans which reside in the parent context. Each child context can override configuration inherited from the parent context.

Furthermore, we can use contexts to prevent beans registered in one context from being accessible in another. This facilitates the creation of loosely coupled modules.

Using SpringApplicationBuilder API
The SpringApplicationBuilder class provides a fluent API to create a parent-child relationship between contexts using parent(), child() and sibling() methods.

Finally, on running the Spring Boot App we can access both applications at their respective ports using:
localhost:8081/ctx1/home 
localhost:8082/ctx2/greeting
